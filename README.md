# Password-Generator

## Description

This project allows user to create a unique password with 8 - 128 characters from upper case, lower case, numbers and speical characters. This code allows user to click on the generate password button (featured in screenshotd below) using an event listener which will then prompt the user to confirm which how many character and which type that would like to include in the password. If an incorrect number is selected then a alert will notify the user to select a number from 8 -128. After selecting the characters a password will be generated  using a loop to select random character from the concatenated arrays which the user has selected from the prompts. This generated password will then be displayed to the screen for users to copy.
